) VALUES (
  'student_id',
  'email@example.com',
  'Student Name',
  'Education details...',
  'Experience details...',
  'Skills details...',
  'https://github.com/username',
  'https://deployed-project.com',
  'https://demo-video-link.com',
  'https://photo-link.com'
) ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE SET
  name = EXCLUDED.name,
  education = EXCLUDED.education,
  experience = EXCLUDED.experience,
  skills = EXCLUDED.skills,
  github = EXCLUDED.github,
  deployed = EXCLUDED.deployed,
  demo_video = EXCLUDED.demo_video,
  photo_link = EXCLUDED.photo_link,
  updated_at = NOW();
```

## Step 3: Verify the Setup

1. Go to the **Table Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Select the `students` table
3. You should see all your student records
4. Test the application by running:

## Data Structure

The application uses a sophisticated data normalization system that processes raw student data into structured formats:

### Raw Data Fields

### Normalized Data Structure
The application automatically normalizes this data into:

#### Education

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Verify your Supabase URL and API key in `.env`
   - Check if RLS policies allow public read access

2. **No Students Showing**
   - Check if data was inserted correctly in Supabase dashboard
   - Verify the table name is `students`
   - Check browser console for error messages

3. **Search Not Working**
   - Ensure text search indexes are created
   - Check if the search query is properly formatted

4. **Student Detail Page 404**
   - Verify student IDs are correctly generated from emails
   - Check if the dynamic route `[id]` is working

### Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://vfftizjdckmnzreqxfoe.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

## Adding More Students

To add more students to the system:

1. Add their data to the `studentData` array in `scripts/insert-student-data.js`
2. Run the script again: `node scripts/insert-student-data.js`
3. The system will automatically handle duplicates and update existing records

The data normalization system will automatically process any new student data according to the established patterns.
